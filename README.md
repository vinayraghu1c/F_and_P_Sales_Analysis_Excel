# FNP Sales Analysis Dashboard (Excel + Power Query)

This project is a complete sales data analysis and interactive dashboard built using **Excel 2013** with **Power Query**, Pivot Tables, and Pivot Charts.  
It visualizes order patterns, delivery efficiency, top-performing products, and customer behavior for a fictional flower & gifting brand â€” **FNP (Ferns N Petals)**.

### Project Overview

This project walks through a **complete data analysis lifecycle**:
- Cleaning and preparing raw data
- Extracting useful time-based insights
- Calculating custom metrics like revenue and delivery time
- Creating a dynamic and insightful dashboard with slicers

> Built 100% in Excel (no external BI tools), this dashboard is designed to be fast, lightweight, and interactive.

###  Data Cleaning & Transformation

In **Power Query**, the following transformations were applied:

- Removed **null values** and obvious **data entry errors**
- Extracted `Order Month`, `Order Day`, `Delivery Month`, and `Delivery Day` from date fields
- Created a new column:  
  **`Revenue = Quantity Ã— Price`**
- Calculated **Delivery Duration (Days)** using date difference
- Unified occasional mapping from two different sources
- Formatted all text and date columns uniformly for cleaner reporting

> All transformations were done using **Power Query**, making the process repeatable and efficient.

This project was built from scratch with care â€” from data wrangling to dashboard styling â€” as part of my journey to master **data analysis using only Excel**.  
Excel 2013 doesnâ€™t support some modern features, so I handled:
- Custom logic to simulate correlation insights
- Workarounds for slicer behavior and formatting

Let me know if you'd like to collaborate, suggest improvements, or just talk dashboards ðŸ˜Š.
